    <p>While I have used a number of technologies in my years as a developer, my most recent active skills lie in the
        development of Robotic Processing Automations (RPA) using <i>UiPath</i>. I hold an Advanced Developer certification
        in this product.</p>
    <p>
        Prior to this my major skill set is in developing desktop applications and back-end business logic. I am most
        proficient
        with the Microsoft Visual Studio .Net technology in the C# and VB.Net languages. I am an intermediate-level user of
        Microsoft SQL Server as my database layer. I have some experience with ASP.Net code and development methodology. As
        mentioned above, I develop with simplicity and high performance in mind. I have demonstrated many times an ability
        to
        diagnose problems in software and correct same (I.E. "fixing bugs")
    </p>
